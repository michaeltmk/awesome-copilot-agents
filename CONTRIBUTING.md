## How can I help?

Awesome Copilot Instructions is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation or adding instruction files via pull request.

## Adding a Copilot Instruction file

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new folder in the instructions, prompts, skills or custom agents directory within a folder that relates to the correct category and focus area. The folder name should follow this pattern: `technology-focus` For example: `frameworks/nodejs-typescript/azure-function-app`.
3. Add your file (`.instructions.md`, `.prompt.md`, `SKILL.md` in a skill folder, or `.agent.md`) to the new folder.
4. Optionally, include a README.md in the folder to provide credit and a brief description.
5. Update the main README.md file, adding your contribution to the appropriate category and link it to the file URL (required to pass the Awesome list linting rules).
6. Submit a pull request.
